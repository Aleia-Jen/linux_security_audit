# Identity & Access Control Review

## User Accounts
System enumeration identified one primary interactive user account (UID 1000) and multiple system service accounts.

## Privilege Review
The primary user account is configured with full administrative privileges via sudo:

(ALL : ALL) ALL

## Risk Consideration
While standard in default Ubuntu installations, unrestricted administrative privileges increase the potential impact of credential compromise.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing the principle of least privilege by:
- Restricting administrative access to dedicated accounts
- Enforcing multi-factor authentication where applicable
- Monitoring privileged command usage
